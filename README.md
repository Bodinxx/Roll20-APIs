# Roll20 Hit Location API

A Roll20 API script that generates realistic, weighted hit locations for tabletop RPGs.  
This script simulates strikes to different regions of the body, factoring in target size, rarity, and facing (front or back).  
It supports full descriptive outputs including critical multipliers, notes, and dynamic limb side selection (left/right).

- **Compact Roll20 chat card format** using the default template  
- **Single-facing display** (shows only the side that was struck)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Requires a **Roll20 Pro** account (API access).  
2. In your Roll20 game:
   - Go to **Game Settings ‚Üí API Scripts ‚Üí New Script**
   - Name it `HitLocation.js`
   - Paste the script contents
   - Save  
3. In Roll20 chat, use one of the `!hit` commands to test.

## üéõÔ∏è Recommended Macro

To simplify calling the API, create a Roll20 macro:

**Name:** `Hit Location`  
**Command:**
!hit ?{Facing|Front|Back}

‚úÖ This will prompt you to choose Front or Back each time you use it.

## üìò Notes

- The script can easily be expanded with custom hit tables or non-humanoid targets.  
- If you modify weighting or add locations, just adjust the `w:` values in the data arrays.  
- Add more regions (e.g., Tail, Wings, Tentacles) following the same format.
