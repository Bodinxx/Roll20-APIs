# Area Saving Throw (AST)  
### Roll20 API Script

---

## Overview

The **Area Saving Throw** script automates group saving throws and damage resolution for area effects (such as fireballs, dragon breaths, traps, and spells) in Roll20.  
It allows a GM to quickly apply saves, resistances, immunities, and automatic hit point adjustments to multiple tokens ‚Äî complete with chat feedback, damage rolls, and configuration options.

Originally authored and released under the MIT License, this version has been modernized for **Roll20‚Äôs JumpGate API sandbox** to ensure stability and compatibility with the current code environment.

## Usage

To execute a group area save: !ast [Attribute or Bonus] [Advantage?] [Save DC] [Effect on Success] [Damage Formula] [Damage Type]

**Example:**
!ast Dexterity Advantage 15 half 8d6 Fire

This rolls a **Dexterity saving throw** with **advantage**, DC **15**, dealing **8d6 Fire damage** (half on success).

### Custom Save (no ability score)
!ast 5 None 12 half 2d8+3 Lightning

Each selected token rolls with a flat +5 bonus.

## Notes for JumpGate API Users

This version replaces the deprecated JSON parsing roller with a **safe inline-roll system**, ensuring compatibility with JumpGate‚Äôs stricter sandbox:

- Replaces  
  ```js
  JSON.parse(results[0].content).total
with
results[0].inlinerolls[0].results.total

- Adds automatic coercion for state values stored as strings (e.g., "true" ‚Üí true).
- Protects against missing player objects and missing hp attributes.
- Fully backward-compatible with your existing macros and saved game state.

## Example Output
üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Goblin* attempted a *Dexterity* save, *DC 15* to half *[8d6] Fire* damage.
*Goblin failed* the save with a roll of *7 [d20 + 2 DEX]* and took *[[23]] Fire damage*.
- ‚úÖ On success: shows half or no damage as configured.
- ‚úÖ Automatically applies reductions for resistance or immunity.
